####About Me

I specialize in **Ruby on Rails** and **JavaScript** development.

What gets me all revved up? Code as crisp as a **morning breeze**, and algorithms with the elegance of a **1995 Ford Bronco**. Mostly I'm just really into the internet. Can we take a moment to reflect on its glory? I want to be a part of that.

Not long ago I was an engineer testing software for the next-generation GPS satellites. I was introduced to programming while studying engineering in college. It was my favorite part, and I began playing with web development when I was in grad school. The more time I put into it, the more I realized how much I enjoyed it, and I was eventually spending all of my free time on it. So I decided to make the leap from engineering to web development, and now here I am.
