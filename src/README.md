#### About Me

What gets me all revved up? Code as **crisp as a morning wind**, and algorithms with the elegance of a **1995 Ford Bronco**. Mostly, I just really like the internet, so can we take a moment to reflect on its glory? I want to be a part of that. 

I specialize in **Ruby on Rails** and **React/JavaScript** development. I graduated from the University of Colorado at Boulder where I received BS and MS degrees in Aerospace Engineering. After a couple of years of spending all of my free time doing web development, I decided to transition to do it full-time. After that, I worked several years at SpotX developing ad tech software as a team lead. Since leaving SpotX, I've been doing full-stack development at Elevation Corporate Health as well as freelance contract work.

I primarily work with Ruby on Rails and React.js, but am always looking to learn more tools.
