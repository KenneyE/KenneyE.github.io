#### About Me

What gets me all revved up? Code as **crisp as a morning wind**, and algorithms with the elegance of a **1995 Ford Bronco**. 

I specialize in **Ruby on Rails**, **React**, and **Typescript** development. I graduated from the University of Colorado at Boulder where I received Bachelors and Masters d
egrees in Aerospace Engineering with emphasis on Fluids & Propulsion.

Soon after graduation, I found myself spending all of my free time working on web development for pleasure. I decided to transition to doing it full-time.
I worked several years at SpotX developing ad tech software as a team lead. Since then, I've been doing full-stack development at Elevation Corporate Health.
